To gain familiarity with MATLAB, here we will use MATLAB Simulink to test if a system is a time-variant system or a time-invariant system. Please check the provided note (note1.pdf) file. 

If you are asked to do a linearity test of a known dynamical system (an ODE) by using MATLAB Simulink, how would you do that?

MATLAB version used: R2018b
